Supplementary material for our BEA 2023 paper, consisting of both the items generated by GPT-3 which passed the content review and were administered to Mturk workers (under <i>/generated_items</i>) and the prompts used to generate said items (under <i>/prompts</i>).

Prompts are text files marked as either ``simple`` or ``elaborated``, depending on the prompt type. Note that these prompts were also used for GPT-4.

Generated items are csvs with the following columns:

1. ``item``: the item content which consists of the premise and hypothesis, separated by a newline.
2. ``label``: the item label, either entailment, contradiction, or neutral.
3. ``Prompt Type``: Denotes which type of prompt was used to generate the item.
4. ``Top P``: The setting of this parameter used when querying GPT-3.
